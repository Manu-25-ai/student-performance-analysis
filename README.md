📊 Student Marks Analysis & Automated Grading using Python

🎯 Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance based on their average marks and assigns grades automatically using Python (Pandas).
It demonstrates basic data-analysis skills including data loading, processing, conditional logic, and exporting results.

✅ Objectives
Read student marks data from a CSV file
Assign grades based on average marks
Add a new column for grades
Save the updated dataset to a new CSV file

🧠 Grading Criteria
Score Range	Grade
60 – 100	  (A)
 40 – 59	  (B)
 0 – 39    	(C)

🔧 Technologies Used
  1.Python
  2.Pandas

🚀 Result
The program successfully assigns grades to students based on their average marks and saves the updated data into a new CSV file.

💡 Future Improvements
Add more grading categories (A+, B-, etc.)
Visualize results with Matplotlib / Seaborn
Create interactive dashboard (Streamlit)
